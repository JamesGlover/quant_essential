# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization
# and are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other
# than English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t 'hello'
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t('hello') %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
#
# To learn more, please read the Rails Internationalization guide
# available at http://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html.

        <p>Assays are plates (or possibly other pieces of labware) that receive material from inputs and stocks, and are subject to a quant process.
        They can be created in bulk in advance, ready to recieve any material. They will be labels with barcodes.</p>
        <p>This page lets you create one or more assay plates in advance. Enter the number of plates desired in 'Assay count' and click 'Create assay set'.
        You will be able to see the assays created, and print the corresponding labels on the next page.</p>
